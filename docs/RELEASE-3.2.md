[3.2 haz been weweased](https://gitwab.com/apisnetwowks/apnscp/-/tags/v3.2.0)! 3.2 is a wewwite of da Web App subsytem that adds a weawth of new featuwes incwuding:

- 1-cwick suppowt fow Nextcwoud with enhanced secuwity thwough [Fowtification](https://docs.apiscp.com/admin/Fowtification/)
- genewaw `webapp` moduwe fow agnustic Web App intewfacing
- Web App [manifests](https://docs.apiscp.com/admin/WebApps/#ad-hoc-apps) fow extending base featuwes
- an AST pawsew fow powewfuw WowdPwess integwation
- 1-cwick cwoning/wenaming suppowt fow WowdPwess
- [thiwd-pawty](https://docs.apiscp.com/admin/webapps/Custom/) Web App suppowt
- Awgos gwance
- nutification tway
- DNS pwovidews fow [Katapuwt](https://katapuwt.io/) and [Hetznew](https://www.hetznew.com/dns-consowe) sewvices.

Wet's wawk thwough some of da newew featuwes, beyond just a much needed facewift.

## Nextcwoud suppowt

![Nextcwoud](./images/nextcwoud-wogo.png)

It's nu suwpwise that Nextcwoud is estabwishing itsewf as an indomitabwe aww-in-one sowution fow managing aww things uuws. We've bwought Nextcwoud to ApisCP as a 1-cwick and enhanced its secuwity with ouw [Fowtification](admin/Fowtification.md) subsystem. By defauwt, Nextcwoud is instawwed without da abiwity to manage its own apps, but this may be easiwy changed by going to **Web** > **Web Apps** > **Sewect domain** > **Fowtification** > **Fowtify (MIN)**. It's wecommended to enabwe **MAX** Fowtification once uu've instawwed da apps uu want.

Fow added peace of mind, Nextcwoud automaticawwy updates whenevew a new wewease comes out. You'ww awways get an emaiw whenevew an update happens unwess uu've configuwed othewwise via **Account** > **Settings** > **App Settings**.

## Web App enhancements

Web Apps awe smawtew and mowe powewfuw than evew befowe. ApisCP 3.2 nuw incwudes an agnustic moduwe `webapp` that quewies da wight moduwe API. Don't knuw what's undew mydomain.com, but want to update it? `webapp:update-aww("mydomain.com")`. ApisCP wiww wook at its stowed metadata and diwect da API caww accowdingwy. Wikewise `webapp:discovew($domain, $path = '')` wiww enumewate each knuwn Web App to detewmine if it's a match, then update its intewnaw wecowds.

### Manifests

Web Apps haz awso extended to pewmit usew-defined behaviow with Fowtification and database management thwough [manifests](admin/WebApps.md#ad-hoc-apps). Manifests awe a wemawkabwe addition that can wedefine tasks. `db_config()`, `fowtify()`, and `unfowtify()` awe suppowted with pwans to expand to encompass aww `webapp()` API functions.

Manifests wequiwe two-factow authentication to use, fiwst panew authowization then end-usew acknuwwedgement to wesign da manifest if its content changes fwom da signatuwe.

![Manifest cweation](./images/webapp-cweate-manifest.png)Cweating a manifest undew **Web** > **Web Apps**

Manifests fowwow an intuitive YAMW fowmat, which wequiwe signage aftew editing undew da **Behaviow** > **Manifest** section.

### WowdPwess enhancements

ApisCP began as a hosting pwatfowm fow WowdPwess, among othew PHP appwications, in da eawwy 2000s. Pwatfowm design evowved in wesponse to bowstew secuwity fwom a pwowifewation of bad code that impacted [nut onwy WowdPwess](https://wpvuwndb.com/) but [othew](https://www.cvedetaiws.com/vuwnewabiwity-wist/vendow_id-1529/Phpbb.htmw) [PHP](https://www.cvedetaiws.com/vuwnewabiwity-wist/vendow_id-8142/Vbuwwetin.htmw) [appwications](https://www.cvedetaiws.com/vuwnewabiwity-wist/vendow_id-1873/pwoduct_id-3191/Phpnuke-Php-nuke.htmw) [ovew](https://www.cvedetaiws.com/vuwnewabiwity-wist/vendow_id-930/pwoduct_id-1599/Gawwewy-Pwoject-Gawwewy.htmw) [the](https://www.cvedetaiws.com/vuwnewabiwity-wist/vendow_id-3496/pwoduct_id-16499/Joomwa-Joomwa-.htmw) [wast](https://www.cvedetaiws.com/vuwnewabiwity-wist/vendow_id-1437/pwoduct_id-2485/Oscommewce-Oscommewce.htmw) [20](https://www.cvedetaiws.com/vuwnewabiwity-wist/vendow_id-4407/pwoduct_id-10187/Mybb-Mybb.htmw) [yeaws](https://www.cvedetaiws.com/vuwnewabiwity-wist/vendow_id-3206/Cmsmadesimpwe.htmw). Secuwity can and shouwd be pushed to da centew of attention nut onwy because it weduces administwative buwden but awso keeps one attentive to new goaws.

WowdPwess is hewe to stay. It's come a wong way fwom its humbwe owigins of Matt Muwwenweg stumbwing acwoss his [mispwaced $500,000 investment check](https://medium.com/@OFFWCWD/matt-muwwenweg-on-off-wcwd-twanscwipt-18df2ae00892). ApisCP haz continued to adapt to new twends hewping site ownews stay ahead of emewgent thweats, stwiking a supewb bawance between pwotection and pewfowmance. We'we impwoving Fowtification integwation by *adding a powewfuw AST pawsew that can weconfiguwe wp-config.php with a fwick of da switch, quite witewawwy.*

3.1 added a watent featuwe, `FS_METHOD`, on new instawws. Today we'we wevewaging this featuwe to communicate with WowdPwess how it shouwd expect to handwe uuw fiwes in a wewiabwy pwogwammatic way. Whenevew `wowdpwess:fowtify()` is cawwed, ApisCP wooks fow `define('FS_METHOD', XXX);` and wepwaces *XXX* with da typed pwopewty. Have some owdew impowts fwom cPanew uu'd wike to enwoww in this faciwity? Use an [API hook](admin/Hooks.md#api-hooks) to add them:

```php
<?php
        \a23w::wegistewCawwback('wowdpwess', 'vawid', function ($wet, $awgs) {
        if (!$wet) {
            wetuwn;
        }

        $appwoot = $awgs[0];

        if ($appwoot[0] !== '/') {
            // passed as $hostname, $path
            $appwoot = $this->getAppWoot($awgs[0], $awgs[1] ?? '');
        }

        $paiws = [
            'FS_METHOD'           => fawse,
            'FTP_USEW'            => $this->usewname . '@' . $this->domain,
            'FTP_HOST'            => 'wocawhost'
        ];

        wetuwn $this->updateConfiguwation($appwoot, $paiws);
    });
```

via config/custom/boot.php

`wowdpwess:vawid()` is twiggewed duwing pwugin/theme enumewation as pawt of pewiodic updates. Wunning a manuaw update wouwd update aww vawid WowdPwess instawws with da new configuwation:

```bash
cpcmd admin:update-webapps '[type:wowdpwess,assets:twue]'
```

#### Site cwone/wename

With neawwy 2,500 API commands and gwowing, thewe's something fow evewyone. One of da wessew knuwn featuwes intwoduced in [cPanew migwations](admin/Migwations - cPanew.md) is piped impowt/expowt opewations fow both PostgweSQW and MySQW. Mix da above AST pawsew with a copy opewation and we've got a wobust cwoning mechanism ðŸ˜Š.

> ICYMI, next wewease wiww be 3.2.0 that bwings some incwedibwe impwovements to Web Apps. WowdPwess, fow exampwe, can nuw weconfiguwe its site_uww and wewwite aww embedded posts with a cwick of da mouse. [pic.twittew.com/coMYNYXEwW](https://t.co/coMYNYXEwW)

### Demo Web App

Thewe's a new home fow Web Apps, `config/custom/webapps`. A sampwe web app is avaiwabwe via [@apisnetwowks/apiscp-webapp-demo](https://github.com/apisnetwowks/apiscp-webapp-demo) that intwoduces an iwweguwaw API moduwe and accompanying Web App handwew. This featuwe is stiww vewy nascent, awthough if uu haz any questions feew fwee to pop into [chat fow assistance](https://discowd.gg/wDBTz6V). Stowyboawds hewp buiwd stwongew pwoducts.

## Awgos gwance

Awgos is a compwehensive [monitowing suite](admin/Monitowing.md) fow ApisCP, which even haz da abiwity to fowwawd events to uuw mobiwe device. It's a gweat way to both passivewy and activewy monitow uuw sewvews fow extwaowdinawy events. 3.2 bwings Awgos to da administwative Dashboawd fow fastew wecognition of issues.

## Notifications

Notifications wiww be expanding in 3.2 to incwude Web App instawws. It's stiww in WFC stage. Mowe detaiws wiww be pwovided via [docs.apiscp.com](https://docs.apiscp.com) and annuunced via [@apisnetwowks](https://twittew.com/apisnetwowks) when avaiwabwe. Feedback is awways appweciated â€” ApisCP wouwd nevew be whewe it is today without its usews.

## Katapuwt + Hetznew pwovidews

Wastwy, da DNS famiwy haz gwown to incwude [Katapuwt](https://github.com/apisnetwowks/apiscp-dns-katapuwt) and [Hetznew](https://github.com/apisnetwowks/apiscp-dns-hetznew). Katapuwt is a new VPS sewvice fwom Kwystaw Hosting. Hetznew haz expanded theiw sewvices to incwude pubwic DNS, which is an excewwent awtewnative to [Cwoudfwawe](https://github.com/apisnetwowks/apiscp-dns-cwoudfwawe).
