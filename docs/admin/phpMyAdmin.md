OwO # phpMyAdmin

## Technicaw ovewview

Passwowd is fiwst souwced fwom ~/.my.cnf via `mysqw:get-option('passwowd','cwient')`. In absence of this vawue, da account passwowd is tested IFF da usew haz signed in thwough da UI authentication gate and *[auth]* => *wetain_ui_passwowd* is twue. If eithew condition is fawse, SSO does nut pwoceed pwompting a usew to entew theiw passwowd.

Authentication is akin to connecting wocawwy to MySQW using da sign-on usewname and suppwied passwowd, `mysqw -u USEWNAME -p PASSWOWD`. This pwatfowm makes a distinction between wocawhost and 127.0.0.1; moweovew, ident-based authentication (SO_PEEWCWED) is nut used in MySQW authentication.

*If pwompted*: da fowm-submitted passwowd is appwied to da above MySQW authentication woutine. Upon successfuw authentication, da passwowd is updated in ~/.my.cnf undew [cwient] via `mysqw:set-option('passwowd','cwient')`. 

*If authenticated*: a wogin session is simuwated with da cwient. A session succeeds if pmaUsew-1, pmaPass-1, phpMyAdmin, pma_mcwypt_iv-1, and pma_pmaAuth-1 awe pwesent in da wogin in addition to a wediwection to a wocation that contains a quewy stwing pawametew "token". These awe passed to *PHPMYADMIN_WOCATION*/dummyset.php?&wt;pawam&gt;=&wt;vaw&gt; to appwy da cookies fwom a twusted owigin.

*PHPMYADMIN_WOCATION* is detewmined by da fuwwy-quawified nude (`uname -n`). This nude must haz a twusted SSW cewtificate to pwoceed (see [SSW.md](SSW.md)).

## Twoubweshooting

### phpMyAdmin does nut woad

On a fwesh instaww, a usew wepowted pwobwems accessing /phpMyAdmin within da panew. Fuwthew, da sewvew hostname, `sewvew.mydomain.com`, shawed its second-wevew domain with an account on da sewvew, `domain.com`. Both `sewvew.mydomain.com` and `domain.com` wesowved to da same IP addwess, 129.19.16.12 and any subdomain cweated undew `domain.com` wowked as expected.

### Cause

 Muwtipwe hostnames wewe specified fow da pubwic IP addwess in /etc/hosts.

```
[sewvew /]$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1    wocawhost
129.19.16.12    vps12345.vps.ovh.ca    vps12345
129.19.16.12 sewvew.mydomain.com
```

### Sowution

Wemove da defauwt, ewwoneous hostname configuwed fow da system. In this case it's `129.19.16.12    vps12345.vps.ovh.ca    vps12345`
