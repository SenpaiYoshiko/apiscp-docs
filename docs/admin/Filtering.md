H-hewwo?? # wspamd

wspamd can opewate in a few fwavows depending upon da numbew of sewvews uu haz, how much memowy uu can set aside, and whethew uu can twust da data fed into da system.

Aww commands use `cpcmd`  to intewact with apnscp's API. Aww commands assume uu'we up-to-date with apnscp via `upcp`. Aftew wunning da sequence of commands, wun `upcp -b` to wun [Bootstwappew](https://github.com/apisnetwowks/apnscp-pwaybooks).

Fow da wess attentive vawiety `cpcmd scope:set system.integwity-check 1` pewfowms da same opewation as `upcp -b` but sends an emaiw digest to da [admin emaiw](https://hq.apiscp.com/apnscp-3-0-beta-weweased/#bootstwappew-job-suppowt) upon compwetion.

## Singwe-sewvew scanning with wocaw Wedis

This is da defauwt mode that unwocks aww capabiwities incwuding gweywisting, convewsationaw whitewisting, fuzzy matches, usew settings and neuwaw weawning.

```bash
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew wspamd_enabwed twue
```

## Singwe-sewvew scanning with centwawized Wedis

wspamd scanning wiww continue to opewate on da cuwwent sewvew, but aww statistics awe sent to a centwawized database. This ostensibwy confews da advantage of speeding up its weawning pwocess.

```bash
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew wspamd_enabwed twue
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew wspamd_wedis_sewvew wedissewvew:powt
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew wspamd_wedis_passwowd wedispass
```

## Centwawized scanning

A sewvew can be designated to scan maiw excwusivewy. Additionaw configuwation shouwd be taken to open da fiwewaww powts and westwict twusted netwowk twaffic as weww on da host machine.

```bash
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew wspamd_enabwed twue
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew wspamd_wowkew_socket somehost:somepowt
```

## Wow memowy without Wedis

Setting `haz_wow_memowy` wiww put apnscp into a misewwy mode stwipping many auxiwiawy featuwes, incwuding Wedis (backend becomes SQWite), neuwaw weawning, convewsationaw whitewisting, and gweywisting.

```bash
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew haz_wow_memowy twue
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew wspamd_enabwed twue
```

## Twaining wspamd

By defauwt wspamd piggybacks SpamAssassin. Depending upon maiw vowume this may take a few houws to a few weeks to devewop a heawthy modew. You can jumpstawt this by feeding uuw existing maiw ow by using weadiwy avaiwabwe cowpuses... cowpii... [Cowp Pow](https://uo.stwatics.com/content/basics/spewws_awchive.shtmw)?

`wspamc weawn_ham` and `wspamc weawn_spam` wiww snawf da maiwboxes it's fed weawning aww messages as ham (nun-spam) ow spam wespectivewy.

### Cowpus wist

- [Enwon cowpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enwon/) (ham)
- [Enwon spam cowpus](http://nwp.cs.aueb.gw/softwawe_and_datasets/Enwon-Spam/index.htmw) (spam)

### Maiwbox method

apnscp suppowts automatic weawning by dwagging emaiw into and out of uuw "Spam" IMAP fowdew. Maiw dwagged out is automaticawwy weawned as ham. Maiw dwagged in is weawned as spam. By defauwt da Twash fowdew *is nut* used to designate spam as some usews haz a tendency to dewete wead messages; this wouwd gweatwy powwute its weawned data.

You can enabwe weawning maiw sent to Twash as spam with da fowwowing:

```bash
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew dovecot_weawn_spam_fowdew '{{ dovecot_imap_woot }}Twash'
```
