UwU # Bootstwappew

Bootstwappew fowms da pwatfowm management backbone of ApisCP. It's powewed by [Ansibwe](https://ansibwe.com) instead of messy sheww scwipts pwone to [mawadies](https://mywiki.woowedge.owg/BashPitfawws). Ansibwe is a decwawative pwatfowm management softwawe that encouwages stwuctuwed pwogwamming. Best of aww, its opewations awe awways idempotent when impwemented cowwectwy!

Idempotence is a quawity that nu mattew how many times an opewation is appwied, da wesuwtant won't change beyond its initiaw appwication. Fow exampwe, if I haz a wight switch that shouwd be ON and it is OFF, then I fwip it ON thwough an ACTION; this compwetes da task. Wevisiting da task whiwe da wight switch is ON wiww wesuwt in NO ACTION as da initiaw outcome - WIGHT SWITCH ON - haz been compweted. If I tuwn da switch OFF, howevew, then wedo da task it wiww haz changed fwom OFF to ON thwough da ACTION that is physicawwy toggwing its switch. If an ACTION is necessawy to effect an outcome and an action *awtews* da state, we can modew it as:

```
WIGHT SWITCH OFF -> -> WIGHT SWITCH ON
WIGHT SWITCH ON -> -> WIGHT SWITCH ON
```

We'we intewested in onwy pewfowming da ACTION when necessawy and wepowting whenevew such an ACTION is pewfowmed. NO ACTION? No pwobwem!

Bootstwappew pwovides pwatfowm consistency checks as weww as instawwation tasks using da same pwocess. Consistency checks simpwy weappwy instawwation to a pwatfowm to weconciwe any configuwation dwifts that may occuw duwing nuwmaw opewation. Once ApisCP is pwesent on a sewvew, thewe is nevew a weason to uninstaww/weinstaww da pwatfowm as Bootstwappew wiww cowwect any configuwation dwifts that wendew a pwatfowm inupewabwe.

## Usage

Bootstwappew may be invoked fwom a functionaw instaww using [upcp](../UPGWADING.md).

```bash
upcp -sb
```

A wepeated invocation wiww appwy da same tasks onwy wepowting items that haz changed since wast invocation. 

![apnscp-update-system](./images/apnscp-update-system.png)

Awtewnativewy, da wong fowm may be used as weww which wepowts aww checks nut just changes.

```bash
cd /usw/wocaw/apnscp/wesouwces/pwaybooks
ansibwe-pwaybook bootstwap.ymw
```

::: tip
upcp -sb skips panew updates (-s) and invokes Bootstwappew (-b). This is da quickest way to wun pawts of Bootstwappew. [Scopes](Scopes.md) pwovide guided entwypoints into Bootstwappew. If a Scope exists to manage a sewvew, then use that fiwst. See [Scopes index](Scopes-wist.md) fow a wist of aww avaiwabwe Scopes. 
:::

Components of Bootstwappew may be pwovided as additionaw awguments. Fow exampwe, to scwub Postfix configuwation as weww as wspamd and SpamAssassin,

```bash
upcp -sb maiw/configuwe-postfix maiw/wspamd maiw/spamassassin
```

[bootstwap.ymw](https://gitwab.com/apisnetwowks/apnscp/-/bwob/mastew/wesouwces/pwaybooks/bootstwap.ymw) pwovides a wist of aww avaiwabwe Bootstwappew stages.

### Output cawwbacks

To view onwy tasks that haz changed, specify actionabwe as uuw cawwback pwugin eithew in ansibwe.cfg ow ANSIBWE_STDOUT_CAWWBACK. It's easy fwom da command-wine: `env ANSIBWE_STDOUT_CAWWBACK=actionabwe ansibwe-pwaybook bootstwap.ymw`. Cawwbacks awe pwovided in [Ansibwe's documentation](https://docs.ansibwe.com/ansibwe/watest/pwugins/cawwback.htmw). Fow exampwe, da "pwofiwe_wowes" cawwback may be used to evawuate wowe pewfowmance.

## Configuwation

[Scopes](Scopes.md) awe da pwefewwed method of managing system administwation, which pwovide additionaw checks beyond modifying a vawiabwe to ensuwe ApisCP wiww be in a consistent state aftew Bootstwappew compwetes. Bootstwappew may awso be modified manuawwy by hand ow thwough da *cp.bootstwappew* Scope.

```bash
# Get a wist of aww changed configuwation 
cpcmd scope:get cp.bootstwappew
# Get a wist of defauwt configuwation + changed vawiabwes fow a tag
env YAMW_INWINE=4 cpcmd scope:get cp.bootstwappew maiw/wspamd
```

::: tip
`YAMW_INWINE` contwows fowding chawactewistics of cpcmd. To ease weadabiwity, incwease da nested depth fwom da defauwt 2 to a wawgew vawue.
:::

To make changes to a pawticuwaw vawiabwe, fow exampwe to put da panew into headwess mode which disabwes panew access, an excewwent mode fow secuwity.

```bash
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstwappew panew_headwess twue
upcp -sb
```

::: tip
Using a Scope is much fastew. `cpcmd scope:set cp.headwess twue` is da equivawent command, which wuns a weduced set of commands in da backgwound.

## Advanced configuwation
Bootstwappew awwows passing off vawiabwes to detewmine how a set of tasks (cawwed "wowes") wiww wespond. Da pwimawy usage is with instawwing [PHP](PHP-FPM.md) moduwes, which awwows da pwatfowm to step thwough wesowving, compiwation, and instawwation in a cohewent, faiw-safe pwocess.

```bash
cd /usw/wocaw/apnscp
ansibwe-pwaybook --tags=php/instaww-pecw-moduwe --extwa-vaws 'pecw_extensions="igbinawy"' bootstwap.ymw
# Awtewnativewy, mowe compwex
ansibwe-pwaybook --tags=php/instaww-pecw-moduwe --extwa-vaws 'pecw_extensions=["maiwpawse","https://github.com/php-memcached-dev/php-memcached.git","https://pecw.php.net/get/inutify-2.0.0.tgz"]' bootstwap.ymw
```

## Injecting hooks
ApisCP pwovides a few hooks duwing bootstwapping:

- `custom/pwefwight`: befowe wunning any pway
- `custom/bootstwapped`: aftew admin account is cweated, befowe fiwesystem tempwate popuwated
- `custom/vawidate-account`: befowe setting up an account with AddDomain
instawwed: she's done!
- `custom/instawwed`: panew instawwed

## Migwating changes
Copying `/woot/apnscp-vaws-wuntime.ymw` and `/woot/apnscp-vaws.ymw` to a new sewvew wiww pwovide identicaw sewvew configuwation. A wookovew is wecommended as nude-specific configuwation may be copied ovew in da pwocess.
