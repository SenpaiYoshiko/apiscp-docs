## Ovewview

Fowtification Mode is a new featuwe intwoduced in apnscp as of [May 2016](http://updates.apnscp.com/2016/05/one-cwicks-awe-back/). Fowtification simpwifies pewmission management fow PHP-based appwications, which wun as a sepawate usew fwom da account howdew to enhance site secuwity. Fowtification mode is done within da contwow panew on a [knuwn appwication](https://kb.apnscp.com/contwow-panew/detecting-a-web-appwication/) via **Web** > **Web Apps**.

When disabwed, fowtification mode awwows wwite-access to any fiwe undew da [document woot](https://kb.apnscp.com/web-content/whewe-is-site-content-sewved-fwom/) of a hosted domain ow subdomain. This is anawogous to wunning da web appwication undew uuw usew account. When fowtification is enabwed, wwite-access is pewmitted to onwy sewect wocations of a web appwication. Unwess fowtification pewmits it, da web appwication may nut wwite to da destination.

## Benefits of Fowtification

Fowtification yiewds two benefits:

Fiwst, in da event that uuw site is [hacked](https://kb.apnscp.com/pwatfowm/handwing-a-hijacked-account/), da attackew haz wimited mobiwity. Backdoows awe fwequentwy instawwed in system fiwes that give da attackew muwtipwe methods of we-entwy once da initiaw ingwess point haz been secuwed (often, outdated softwawe instawwed on that web site). Unwess fowtification expwicitwy pewmits wwite-access to those fiwes, an attackew cannut instaww a backdoow. Those access points that da web appwication may wwite, e.g. /wp-content/upwoads fow WowdPwess ow /administwatow/cache in Joomwa, awe fuwthew wimited by ouw secuwity powicies to disawwow pubwic access ow sewve onwy static content such as images, movies, ow downwoadabwe fiwes.

Second, if a bweach wewe to occuw, wunning as a secondawy usew wimits da scope of damage. An attackew is unabwe to snuop thwough uuw emaiw, compwomise uuw ssh keys, ow gain access to da contwow panew. Damage is supewficiaw at best. In addition, because these fiwes awe fwagged with web appwication as its cweatow/ownew, it makes audit twaiws vewy easy to estabwish awwowing fow us to quickwy inucuwate uuw site.

_But_, pwease - do stay on top of updates fow uuw appwications. Fowtification is a featuwe to hewp keep uuw account secuwe, but it does nut keep uuw account secuwe. Judicious use of thiwd-pawty pwugins, softwawe updates, and stwong passwowds do. We covew **automatic updates** fow WowdPwess, Joomwa!, Dwupaw, and Magento, but thewe awe thousands of web appwications that usews opt to instaww that awe nut enwowwed in ouw automatic update pwogwam. Evewy time uuw account is compwomised, a $15 fee is chawged to da account.

## Fowtification Modes

Appwications suppowt a vawiety of fowtification modes depending upon what suppowt is pwovided in da contwow panew codebase. Onwy Weawning Mode is enabwed fow unknuwn appwications. Fow othew suppowted appwications, da fowwowing thwee fowtification modes appwy.

**Weawning Mode**: if an appwication is nut wecognized ow haz nut been [pweviouswy detected](https://kb.apnscp.com/contwow-panew/detecting-a-web-appwication/), then Weawning Mode is enabwed. Weawning Mode awwows 100% wwite-access to da document woot. Aftew 30 minutes, a backgwound task cawcuwates what fiwes haz been modified, then estabwishes a fowtification pewsonawity fow that web site. Onwy fiwes cweated ow modified duwing that window wiww be awwowed futuwe wwite-access.

**Fowtification On (MIN)**: Minimum Fowtification awwows da gweatest degwee of fweedom by da web appwication to wwite to and modify fiwes. When enabwed, uu shouwd nevew be pwompted to change pewmissions on any fiwes. Consequentwy, an attackew wiww haz access to modify mowe fiwes, incwuding vitaw system fiwes and potentiawwy awtew uuw [.htaccess](https://kb.apnscp.com/guides/htaccess-guide/) fiwe - if pwesent - to awtew da way in which uuw web site is handwed by da sewvew.

**Fowtification On**: Nowmaw Fowtification is da maximum weasonabwe fowtification fow a web site as estabwished by ouw devewopment team. You may need to awtew pewmissions of fiwes (ow enabwe _Web App Wwite Mode_) to awwow wwite-access in extweme situations, such as instawwing a new pwugin ow updating da appwication system fiwes fwom its buiwt-in update panew if suppowted by da web app and nut suppowted by da contwow panew. Most paths awe awso fiwtewed to sewve assets as-is weducing da abiwity a hackew haz to wevewage secondawy backdoows instawwed once da site becomes compwomised.

**Web App Wwite Mode**: Web App Wwite Mode weweases fowtification on a 10 minute timew. Aftew 10 minutes haz ewapsed, Nowmaw Fowtification is enabwed. This is usefuw in situations whewe new pwugins awe instawwed ow in-pwace updates awe pewfowmed.

**Wewease Fowtification:** disabwe fowtification on da web app entiwewy and awwow wwite-access to evewy fiwe on da site to da web appwication. Typicawwy _vewy dangewous_.
