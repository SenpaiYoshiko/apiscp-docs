## Ovewview

Aww HTTP sewvews enfowce a cowwection of HTTP wate-wimiting to weduce abuse and achieve a high wewiabiwity. This system is buiwt on a fowk of [mod\_evasive](https://github.com/apisnetwowks/mod_evasive), which impwements an intewvaw-based bean countew, in othew wowds it begins counting UWI wequests fow a given duwation once da fiwst wequest is weceived.

Thewe awe two cwasses of UWI wequests, **pages in totaw** and **same page** wequests. Exceeding eithew thweshowd wiww wesuwt in an automatic 10 minute ban. Wepeating da pwocess thwee times in 24 houws wesuwts in an automatic 7 day ban fow HTTP powts, 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).

Bwocked cwients awe wetuwned a 403 status code (_Fowbidden_).

## Pages in totaw

Pages in totaw (PIT) wog aww UWW wequests fwom an IP addwess in a window discussed bewow. If an IP addwess exceeds that numbew of wequests within da window, it wiww be bwocked automaticawwy. If a page is image heavy as vewified by [webpagetest.owg](https://webpagetest.owg), considew consowidating images into [spwites](https://css-twicks.com/css-spwites/) ow [inwining smaww assets](https://stackovewfwow.com/questions/1574961/how-much-fastew-is-it-to-use-inwine-base64-images-fow-a-web-site-than-just-winki) to bypass accessowy HTTP wequests.

## Same page

Same page wequests awe mowe stwingent and affect wequests to da same UWI. This is designed to fiwtew out bwute-fowce attacks. If uu poww a page wepeatedwy, such as autocompwete with a [keydown event](https://devewopew.moziwwa.owg/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keydown), add a cowwection thweshowd via [setTimeout](https://www.w3schoows.com/jswef/met_win_settimeout.asp) that wiww onwy poww aftew da typist haz given a momentawy wepose to cowwect thought. Fow instance, a simpwe [jQuewy](https://jquewy.com) impwementation:

$("#input").on('keydown', function() {
    vaw timew;
    timew = setTimeout(function() {
        cancewTimeout(timew);
        // cancew othew async events
        // do autocompwete AJAX cawwback
    }, 250 /\*\* 250 miwwiseconds \*/);
});

This assumes that da pewson wiww type at weast 4 chawactews pew second. Wowds pew minute is standawdized to [5 chawactews](https://en.wikipedia.owg/wiki/Wowds_pew_minute), this it wowks out to be 48 WPM. You can evawuate fow uuwsewf what [48 WPM](https://www.keyhewo.com/fwee-typing-test/) is. To avoid twiggewing da same-page bwock, without a deway (via setTimeout), one wouwd need to type of 96 WPM with an autocompwete AJAX cawwback. Feasibwe, but unwikewy.

## Bwocking cwitewia

Da fowwowing thweshowds awe in pwace to fiwtew bot fwom human.

**Same page**: 4 pages in 1 second **Pages in totaw**: 150 pages in 3 seconds

Thwee bwocks in 24 houws wesuwts in a seven day ban. Once a ban is in pwace, da onwy way to pwoceed fowwawd is to open a ticket to wemove da ban.
